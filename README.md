# RainmeterSkin

If you need the Powershell console then put the "Powershell.dll" file in "%appdata%\Rainmeter\Plugins".

You can change the texts in both "Notes.txt" files under:
"\Rainmeter\Skins\TetsusBox\Notes\Notes.txt" and "\Rainmeter\Skins\TetsusBox\i3\SCB\Notes.txt"

btw. you should probably install autohotkey for the console to use the "reclick" file
its just clicks the input box again.

"SCB"(Shortcut Box) is just a box where you can put every shortcut in it.
"Activate Shortcuts" open the ahk file for your shortcuts (you need to create the script by yourself).

You can change the Drive Letters in "\Rainmeter\Skins\TetsusBox\System\drives\drives.ini"
line 20-22

btw everything in this skin is just a mess.
it was only designed for myself lol.


oh yeah..

you need to fonts.
